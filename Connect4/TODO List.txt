* Generate opening moves database.
  - Verify with http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connect-4.
  - Should be one of the last steps of the project as the remaining optimisations and
    testing must be completed first.

* Optimise.
  - Improve the evaluation function.
    > Ignore 3 piece streaks which are blocked on either side. This will hurt the nodes
      per second but could be used for better move ordering and in turn reduce the number
      of nodes to search.
    > The 3 piece streak may not even be a good heuristic.
  - Parallel Minimax.
    > http://www.pressibus.org/ataxx/autre/minimax/paper.html is a good starting point.
  - The Move()/UndoMove() methods are the new bottlenecks.
    > Move 'nextFreeTile' array into 'playerPositions'?

* Testing.
  - Whole system test: create an auto player which systematically plays, at least,
    thousands of games against the AI.
  - More unit tests.
  - More assertions.
